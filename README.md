# Rough Sketch Project Idea
We want to use historical weather data for near a farm and be able to predict crop yields/growing properly based on crop reaction

# UI
Make a website user interface that predicts specific crop yields in certain locations based on an weather app api and soil type. The user interface will consist of a typing menu where you will input location, crop type, and soil information. When location has been selected an image of a zoomable map of that area will appear with whatever choices selected and a prediction of that information.

# ML Model
A ml model will use old data (weather data patterns and crop reaction to those types of weather in different soils) and predict the outcome of certain crops in different areas.
