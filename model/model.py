# issue lies with the problem being related to annotation field missing in older Python packages (description field) for parsing or parser. So the model configuration require to ignore such missing fields and this requires to be supported in the new pydantic package that is being used

# the keep_untouched model variable in older version but that is also not implemented/or no examples on using that attribute in the model config
